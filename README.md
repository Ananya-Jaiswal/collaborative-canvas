# Real-Time Collaborative Canvas

A real-time, multi-user collaborative drawing canvas built using **HTML5 Canvas**, **Node.js**, and **Socket.IO**.  
Multiple users can draw, erase, undo, redo, and view each other’s cursors live across different browsers and devices.

**Live Demo:**  
https://collaborative-canvas-9e2d.onrender.com/

> Note: The project is deployed on Render (Free Tier).  
> If the app has been inactive, the first load may take a few seconds while the server wakes up.

 Known Limitations
Deployed using Render Free Tier, so the server may sleep after inactivity.

No user authentication (all users are anonymous).

In-memory state (resets on server restart).

These trade-offs were made intentionally for simplicity and clarity.

 Future Enhancements
Persistent storage (database-backed history)

User authentication and usernames

Rooms / multiple canvases

Export canvas as image

Permissions and role-based access
